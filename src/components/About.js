        Welcome She Chats Tech is an educational and social platform that aims
        to inspire and motivate women in their tech journeys. With an emphasis
        on in-person connection She Chats Tech was created to provide a safe
        space where women could build networks, inspire eachother and learn
        about the industry. Networking is a fundamental skill and finding your

        represent 26% of the tech workforce. Focusing on university students and
        early tech career professionals we hope to bring people together with
